# Infectious Disease Spread Modelling with ABM

## Overview
This project utilizes an Agent-Based Model (ABM) to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in a given area over time. The aim is to create a computational model that demonstrates the pattern of disease transmission, considering factors like recovery rates, infection rates, and population movement. 2D-ABMs offer a more simple view of disease dynamics and the impact of policies, and is able to show emergent properties over a period of time.

## Methodology
- **Model Description:** Uses ABMs to represent individual interactions and their environment, capturing the dynamics of disease transmission.
- **Assumptions and Rules:** Agents follow specific location and infection rules, dictating their movement, infection probability, and recovery.
- **Model Configuration:** Configured with parameters like infection rate, vaccination status, and environmental settings to simulate various scenarios.
- **Results Analysis:** Infection rates, vaccination impacts, and disease hotspots are analyzed to understand disease dynamics.

## Key Findings
- Infection rates show a sharp increase initially, then a decline, illustrating rapid spread followed by effective intervention.
- Higher vaccination rates significantly reduce death rates.
- The model reveals emergent patterns, such as the concentration of infections in certain areas.

## Future Work
Future enhancements may include additional parameters like healing ability and weather conditions to further refine the model's applicability to real-world infectious disease challenges.
